# 📖 LexiVerse

**LexiVerse** is an immersive vocabulary platform that blends storytelling with deep linguistic exploration.  
Instead of learning isolated words, users encounter advanced vocabulary inside curated narrative passages and explore each word’s meaning, usage, and historical evolution.

## 🌟 Project Vision

LexiVerse was designed to transform vocabulary learning into an engaging reading experience.  
Every word carries history — from Latin and Greek origins to modern usage — presented in a structured, interactive format.

This is not a dictionary.  
It is a layered language experience.
