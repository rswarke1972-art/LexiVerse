            The king had once ruled with an iron certainty, yet the whispers in the court began to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abate">abate</button> 
            only when fear replaced loyalty. Rumors spread that his recent decrees would 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abase">abase</button> 
            the dignity of the council, reducing proud nobles to obedient shadows.

        <p>
            When a young minister dared to question him publicly, the monarch did not 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abash">abash</button>; 
            instead, he watched with a cold composure that felt strangely 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="aberrant">aberrant</button>, 
            as though he were detached from the very kingdom he ruled.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then came the mysterious disappearance of a provincial governor — whispers of an 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abduction">abduction</button> 
            carried through the corridors of the palace. Some believed that unseen hands within the court had chosen to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abet">abet</button> 
            the act in order to tighten their quiet control.
        </p>

        <p>
            Protest gathered beyond the gates, yet military action remained in 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abeyance">abeyance</button>. 
            Generals hesitated, uncertain whether loyalty required obedience or courage.
        </p>

        <p>
            In private chambers, letters arrived urging the king to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abdicate">abdicate</button>, 
            to relinquish the throne before unrest devoured the realm. Yet he seemed to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abhor">abhor</button> 
            the very notion of surrender, as though stepping down would dissolve his identity.
        </p>

        <p>
            His final address to the kingdom was unusually brief — as if he sought to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abbreviate">abbreviate</button> 
            not just his speech, but the gravity of his own downfall.

        <p>
            And thus the crown did not fall in battle. It eroded — quietly, steadily — until even silence refused to obey him.

            Long before empires rose, there existed tribes who lived without walls or crowns. They were called 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="aboriginal">aboriginal</button> 
            not because they lacked wisdom, but because they belonged to the first rhythm of the earth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their survival was not romantic — it was harsh, often 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abject">abject</button> 
            in its vulnerability. Storms did not negotiate. Hunger did not forgive.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yet every dawn began with ritual 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="ablution">ablution</button>, 
            washing away the dust of yesterday as if cleansing both body and doubt.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some leaders demanded total 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abnegation">abnegation</button> 
            of self — sacrifice for the tribe, silence for unity. Others chose to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abjure">abjure</button> 
            violence, believing restraint was strength.
        </p>

        <p>
            But not all efforts flourished. Many settlements were 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abortive">abortive</button>, 
            collapsing under famine or fear before they could become history.
        </p>

            Tools made of stone would 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abrade">abrade</button> 
            against bone and bark, while disputes between clans grew 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abrasive">abrasive</button>, 
            grinding trust into fragments.
        </p>

            Over time, laws were formed to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abolish">abolish</button> 
            practices deemed cruel or 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abominable">abominable</button>,

        <p>
            Civilization did not appear in triumph. It emerged slowly — shaped by friction, refined by failure, and carried forward by those who refused to remain forgotten.

            The scholar believed that truth did not need to be loud to be

            In fact, he often chose to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abstain">abstain</button> 
            from debate, convinced that wisdom sometimes grows in quiet soil.

            His writings were rarely simple. Many found them 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abstruse">abstruse</button>, 
            drifting into the

            realms of thought where only patience could follow.

            his work into digestible fragments, but meaning cannot always be shortened without being damaged.

            When scandal threatened his reputation, one of his students chose to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abscond">abscond</button> 
            with confidential manuscripts, fearing the truth would be misused.
        </p>

            Yet the scholar refused to 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="absolve">absolve</button> 
            himself of responsibility. He believed that knowledge must be carried, not escaped.
        </p>

        <p>
            He lived an 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abstemious">abstemious</button> 
            life, practicing deliberate 
            <button class="word-btn" data-word="abstinence">abstinence</button> 
            from excess, allowing his mind to fully

            the silence that others feared.

        <p>
            In the end, it was not argument that defined him — but restraint. Not noise — but discipline.

            Yet progress began to <button class="word-btn" data-word="accelerate">accelerate</button>

            Investors were eager to <button class="word-btn" data-word="accede">accede</button>

            the virtues of the crown with such conviction that the court could not ignore him.

            It did not take long for him to <button class="word-btn" data-word="acclimate">acclimate</button> 
            to the rituals of power. The steep <button class="word-btn" data-word="acclivity">acclivity</button>

            Yet with prominence came compromise. He learned to <button class="word-btn" data-word="accommodate">accommodate</button>
